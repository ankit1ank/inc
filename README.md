# An incremental scheme compiler

A tiny scheme to x86 asm compiler developed incrementally as described in the
paper [An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction][1] by Abdulaziz
Ghuloum.

The code is tested with Chez Scheme 9.4.

    $ make test

The Dockerfile should make it easier to get started.
